This is a script that creates an FTP user and an FTP site. Important Powershell must be run as admin. In addition, the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager should be activated in the Windows Features. The Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager can then be used to manage the page after it has been created. (To change the password for FtpUser press Win and R then enter netplwiz and change the password of FtpUser there.)
